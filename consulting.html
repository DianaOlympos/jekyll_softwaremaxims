  What your team can get from me
</h1>

    <p class="font-medium">
      You have great people, and you know they could be an amazing team. Delivering
      on business need, inspired, a real competitive advantage. Not held-back by long
      repetitive process, problems they have to solve over and over again.
    </p>

    <p class="font-medium">
      Most of these problems are systemic. Your people are great, the way their tools
      and process are organised hold them back. I want to give your team the tools
      to change their process and become a great learning system made of learning parts.
    </p>

    <p class="font-medium">
      I can bring years of experience helping and building teams, particularly on the Elixir world.

    Help in your DevOps journey
  </h2>
  <p>
    I have gone through that journey multiple times and built teams that deliver
    tremendous business value. I can inspire your team with lessons from teams
    that succeeded at this transformation and i can also help with technical
    problems.
  </p>

  <h2 class="header-section-title"> Release Engineering and deployment tooling </h2>
  <p>
    Does your deployment process means a lot of clicking and typing ? It can take
    months to get team members up to speed ? I can help level up your team's skill
    at creating and maintaining smooth automations to get both dev and production
    environement up to speed quickly.
  </p>

  <h2 class="header-section-title"> Help your Elixir codebase </h2>
  <p>
    I can evaluate your code base quality. At the end of this process, you will
    have a clear blueprint of what actions to take. Your team will know what to do
    to work on a nicer code base everyday. You will also have faster velocity and
    can expect your team to feel they contribute high quality code.
  </p>

  <h2 class="header-section-title"> Move to Elixir </h2>
  <p>
    You have a project that would profit from Elixir strengths but your team is not
    100% confident in their abilities in the language ? My experience organising
    and building team on the language can help. I can provide mentoring and
    training for your team, on an ongoing basis. They will get productive quickly
    and i can accompany them while they grow their knowledge to ensure that your
    project is high quality even in a new language.
  </p>


  <h2 class="header-section-title"> Your specific need </h2>
  <p>
    The most well placed person to know your needs are yourself. Maybe you think
    i could bring something else to your team or have particular needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a few hours or a few months, I'd love to learn about what you are doing, ask
    useful questions, dig in and help your team become a great learning system.

    Let's talk. (You can email me at depierre.thomas@gmail.com)
