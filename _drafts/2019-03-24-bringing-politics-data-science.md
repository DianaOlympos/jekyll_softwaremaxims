So a few days ago, [@farbandish pointed me to an interesting paper on twitter](https://twitter.com/farbandish/status/1107137913114882048). We were talking of "ethics" in IT/CS. And i had brought my usual point of developers in general only being interested in the act of building, not in the act of applying it to help.

The draft paper made me think a lot and i want to put my thinking out there. I like a lot of things in it, but it also generate a lot of "blips" in my "something seems funny" sense. A sense that i am sure a lot of operators of complex system knows. It took me some time to find why, but i think i got some answer after digesting it more.

## Crocodile Tears

This paper concentrate on offering a way for the field of Data Science to decide which projects are socially desirable and how to negotiate between competing perspective of society that a project can impact. I appreciate immensely that Data Science in particular, and the field of CS/IT in general, are talking more and more publicly of these kinds of problems. As engineers building essential underpinning mechanism of society, we can have massive impacts on the social system we are part of. And it is time that we acknowledge that power and work toward orienting it.

The paper center around offering the need for normative structures for Data Scientists. It argue, and i agree, that professional ethics offer you a way to reflect on your actions. But they do not offer the tools to estimate that reflection and decide of the goals you have. They help you estimate how far from a goal after you set one. The paper then move to offer to use "politics" as the tool that can handle the task of framing actions taken by Data Scientists.

By that, it is meant that Data Scientist should create a culture of seeing their output as political actions. It is an appeal to generate that normative framework by letting the actors in the field change their point of view on their actions. It is particularly visible in the number of use of the phrase "Data Scientist must" and "Data Scientist should" in front of the actions expected to derive that normative framework.

And that is where my human factors sense begin to tingle. Yes, there is a tremendous power in a field cultural norms. "This is how things are done" values passed through mentorship in a field are powerful control on the actions of a field. But these values do not come from thin air or wishful thinking that the practitioner will act voluntarily to change them. 

## Something to Believe In

Any field or profession will evolve a set of cultural values. But these values all come from the same point: the social situation the field come from and the pressures and incentives it has to deal with. Form of feedbacks applies to agents or systems will drive and change how they act and in reaction their values. Trying to change a field set of values by having the agents in that field change their actions without changing the system they are in is at best an incredibly difficult task, at worst is going to destroy the agents and be corrected swiftly by the system.

To come back to the paper, i do agree whole heartedly with the debunk of "excuses" given to avoid responsibilities in the recent controversies in Data Science. The same kind of excuses have been used in a wider CS context and my answers have been close to the one given by the paper. [[1]](#fn1){:#ref1}

The difference is the learning to be taken from the wide use of these excuses and the number of controversies rising. The paper understand the learning being that the actors of the field need to wake up and nurture their political conscience. Mine is that the field is deeply lacking the form of feedback and embedding in the wider society that is needed to build accountability.

The reason we call these recent events "controversies" and not "incidents" is because society do not consider them as a problematic. Society is so disconnected from the field, the pressures and expectations from the field are so different from what is the real impact, that there can be no norm. The field is left to self control itself, and that is always a highly unstable situation. Even more, in this kind of self-control, the field will only pursue self-determines objective. It is quite expected that these objectives do not align with wider societal one.

## Blunt

It is especially interesting because the paper engage itself, even if it is in the goal to debunk it, in one of the deeper problem i have with the field of CS. It try to oppose "technological" solutions from "social" one. That separation is quite attractive seeing the current use of these words in the mainstream media, but i would like to point out again that a "technological" solution do not exist. Technology shape models of the worlds and way you interact with it. Any system using technology is by definition socio-technical. You can not have a technological system deployed that is not also a social change.

Some people may say i am pedant, but i think this is deeply important. Especially because the paper engage in the dichotomy of the drive by Data Scientists to "deploy a technological solution" vs "searching a political solution". I think this opposition exist but is slightly different. If the Data Scientists were interesting in "deploying" a solution, then they would already be deeply embedded in political and social problems. The culture i see in CS could be summarized better as the opposition between "building a technology" vs "searching a solution". That may seems like a pedantic difference, but i think it is a deep ontological one.

The field is mostly oriented toward "building" things. Something the paper talk about in the incentives toward "novel contribution". The culture of CS is a culture of "the joy of building" or "the joy of creating". There is really few talks around the impacts of these solutions on people or the work needed to deploy a solution. This is left to others.

This is not only a separation between "solutions searching for a problem" and "solving a problem". The field create tools and then *let others apply them to whatever problems they want*. That is a powerful force to generate experiments of course, but it is also highly problematic. It is the equivalent of making nuclear elements and letting anyone try anything with it. Want to put radium in your curative compress ? Hey why not, it may help with pain and other conditions. I suppose we will see in a decade or two.  [[2]](#fn2){:#ref2}

## Gunfight

The paper then offer a 4 stage process that the field could follow to introduce politics in its culture. It also points out some existing discussions that shows that some of the element of Stage 1 and 2 of this process are already happening. I will quote the text to not simply repeat it in the presentation of this process.

> Stage 1 (interest) involves data scientists becoming interested in working directly on addressing social issues with their work. In Stage 2(reflection), the data scientists involved in that work come to recognize the politics that underlie these issues.This leads to Stage 3(applications), in which data scientists direct the methods at their disposal toward new problems.Finally, Stage 4 (practice) involves the long-term project of developing new methods and structures that orient data science around a politics of social justice.

This seems fairly straightforward as a personal progression of "awakening" to social impact of one work in CS. Except for Stage 4, which is a bit more meta-level and imply changing the place of the field in society and the way it interact with it. Which is also the source of my critic of this framework.

This process happens if the practitioner has external or personal drivers to engage in that route. But it does not provide generic ways for practitioners in the field to engage in it. It does not create incentives for them to do it. It is, in that shape and description, a personal journey. Which should not stop you from following it, but without external and societal pressure to follow it, we can not expect a majority of the field to follow that path.

On top of that, expecting a field that can have that much impact to be mostly driven by personal agency of its elements, without any control action from the rest of society struck me as highly unstable. Stage 4 does offers to build structures and methods that will embed the field in society and politics, but this is still driven mostly by the practitioners or at least the field itself.

Offered like that, this process sounds like Prometheus bringing the light to society. Of course what we bring can help. And of course we will work with society to find when fire is a good solution to a problem. But it is the practitioners that come down to society to be controlled. Not the other way around. The agency stays in the practitioners. It does sound a bit like hubris exposed like that, but i think it is a simple outcome of how much CS separated itself from society as a whole.

## Gun in my Hand

I still think that this framework is onto something. We need to connect these fields of research with society. That goes through building structures that embed the need and control of society on the field. And it also goes through changing the field and its culture, mostly through these needs. We are already seeing people going from Stage 1 to Stage 3. A lot of the time, this is based on their own personal drivers. We are seeing victims of abuse fighting tools with poor control of access, victims of discrimination raise their voice about some controversial use of the tools, etc.

We should be thankful for them. They, and their ally, are the practitioners that will have the internal drive to go through that process. They will also not be enough. To change deeply the way the field works, there is a need to harness their voice and power to change the way the structure that applies to the field. This would i think generate the reverse process to the field.

Changing the structure will push resources toward new problems (Stage 3). That will bring practitioners to recognize the political drive behind their projects and actions (Stage 2). This reflection will raise their interest for what they do socially (Stage 1) or drive them out of the structures of the field. The reason i see this as reverted is that i think it is structural change that drive cultural change, not the other way around.  [[3]](#fn3){:#ref3}

All the examples the paper point of Stage 1 and 2 already happening struck me as highly niche and mostly explainable by the personal drivers i offered. At best, these are seen as "controversies", not incidents of breaking societies, putting life at risks or undermining Human Rights. The process offered by the paper is relevant, but to a far smaller subset of practitioners. To move the entire field toward one politically embedded in society, we need this subset to engage in action creating a reverse process of Stage 4 to Stage 1 for the field.

## It Begins Tonight

The other thing about systemic pressure is that we need to understand them better. The paper seems mainly based as a reaction to a set of controversies. But to be able to begin to address systemic problems, we need to understand the systemic forces at play. We can try to make the data scientists aware of politics all we want, we also need to look at what kind of pressure and demand they face. If the pressure stay the same, providing them with a political conscience will just drive them out of the field.

What does society expect from them ? Why ? What does the people that pay them expect ? Why ? We need to begin to apply systemic and human oriented investigations on the circumstances that created these controversial studies. Find what are the pressure and feedback that brought Data Science where it is today. Maybe we could draw from other technological fields that [learned how to do that kind of investigation](https://www.routledge.com/The-Field-Guide-to-Understanding-Human-Error-3rd-Edition/Dekker/p/book/9781472439055learned how to do that kind of investigation). Let's publish an NTSB-like report on a "wrong" study every time one happen. It will allow us to know where to apply pressure, what to change and more importantly, how the hell did that happen.

There are deep problems in our field. I have my opinions on a couple of them. There are some outcome we all agree are wrong. But it think we really need to stop offering solutions that are just trying to offer a way out, without changing the structure in which we work. We need to stop looking at possible magical solutions that would "wake up" our field. 

We need to work deeply at what are the systemic forces that keep pushing us in that situation and talk about them in a way that can be understood by our field. If you want computer/data scientists to get a better political conscience, show them the system they are part of. Give them the tool to devise solutions. Let's change the systems we are part of instead.
