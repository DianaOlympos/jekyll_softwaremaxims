  <p class="about-p">
    I am Thomas Depierre, a software developer and SRE. If you think i could
    help you, <href href="mailto:depierre.thomas+softwaremaxims@gmail.com"> hit me up </a>.
      I am always happy to exchange on the way i could help
      your projects.I can lead your teams or projects as well as just come to
      teach some best practice to your teams around my main skills, especially
      for teams new to the Elixir language.
  </p>

  <p class="about-p">
    I have a particular love for the Elixir language, and functional
    languages in general. I am also really interested in what keep our
    complex software beating and running, and consequently spend a lot of
    time writing code for the infrastructure that runs software.
  </p>

  <p class="about-p">
    You can find me in multiple place over the Internet and you will find
    all the contact you may need in the footer of this website. I am open to
    any professional inquiries via email.
  </p>

  <p class="about-p">
    I studied software engineering at multiple engineering schools in France
    and worked for multiple companies. I am specialized in complex and
    distributed systems. I am particularly good at "cleaning" existing
    products. If your software became a tangled mess over time, and you
    are not too sure how to make it works as you would like, you are right my
    alley.
