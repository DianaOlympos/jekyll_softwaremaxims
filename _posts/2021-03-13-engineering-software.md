What is an engineer? And engineering? The question is legitimate and pretty hard
to answer. It varies from country to country based on how the profession
developed and the type of contraption that proved particularly central to their
society. <!--more-->
Most of Europe will talk of military engineering and the capability to
build siege contraptions and to bend the landscape to your military needs.
The USA would talk of bridges and rails.

Let's look at how the Conference of Engineering Societies of Western Europe and
the United States of America defined "professional engineer" in 1961.

> A professional engineer is competent by virtue of his/her fundamental education

This is pretty lengthy and basically the core of it is "applying originally and
independently science to solve problems, usually in a group setting, in a
continual manner, responsibly". What this means in practice is that you learn a
ton of science and maths. And then you try to find ways to make it work in your
budget constraints through experiments, luck and bodges. And you keep it safe
through gut feelings and trusting other engineers.

My experience has been that things get messy. That you need dozens of back and
forth between prototypes and production lines until you reach something you can
get to the market. And then discover that you were wrong all along and need to
redo it all, hopefully after learning something from the process.

My experience has been that the best way to know if something will work is to
go to the production line and find someone to build your thing. All your formal
methods and simulation tend to break pretty fast. Oh and whatever your
estimates for mass production were, you are off. By at least a year and
an order of magnitude.

If you are reading that, you are probably working in software. What i described
here is my experience in mechanical, electronic and civil engineering. And what
I learned in engineering school. If that does not look like what you imagine
engineering to beâ€¦ well yeah. It is not.

But you may also think that it looks a lot like how writing software looks.
Except that in our case, changes are relatively easy to do, just a few lines of
text, and need little time. Tests are cheap. And we have an infinitely
malleable process that can work in infinitesimally small chunks. And you would
be right.

What that means is that the arguments that we see used a lot to say that writing
software is not engineering.... basically says the opposite. We do not use formal
methods ? Them neither. We barely test? You should see what QA looks like for your
car.

Writing code and testing it in production is the most refined form of
engineering that exists.

*This post is part of a serie of two. It is, partially, a satire of the arguments I keep seeing about the relationship between engineering and writing software. My own position is that yes, writing software is engineering, but that the discipline called Software Engineering has nothing to do with Engineering. I also do not think that software engineering is "superior" to other forms of engineering. This is the argument of both side pushed to the extreme.*
